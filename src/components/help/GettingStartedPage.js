            <p>The idea is simple. You can give up on math and create a "I'm not a math person" story. Or you can figure out
                why you have had difficulties learning math and fix it. Math is a powertool for modern living.
                </p>
                <p>
                There is this one thing we need to get out of the way right up front. Learning mathematics takes effort. That's true of
                most things that have value. The problem is that many students struggle with math because they missed things. 
                Important, foundational, things. That's what this website is all about. 
                Finding your personal gaps and filling them in. but you have to practice. That's the bottome line. 
                You want to play the guitar? You have to practice. Basketball? You have to practice. Drawing or playing Call of Duty, 
                or killing flies by shooting rubber bands at them? Practice.  
                </p>
                <p>
                So why call it MathHacks? Aren't hackers bad guys? Or at least mis-guided (we're looking at you Elliot)? 
                The answer is that we aren't trying to create mathematicians. If you are on that track you don't need our help. 
                We want to help fill gaps in your personal knowledge and, as you do, you'll learn how a few rules, recipies and formulas 
                can take you a long way when solving math problems. Especially problems on math tests.  
                </p>

                You can  poke around to see what's here or you can read our brief getting started guide. If you think this might be

                If you go ahead and create an account we suggest that you create a user name and password that will help protect your identity. 
                We won't do anything, ever, that might violate your trust. But the Internet is full of people who will so learn how to protect your privacy 
                everywhere you can.
